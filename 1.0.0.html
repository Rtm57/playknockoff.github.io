												<h2>Knock-Off Version 1.0.0</h2>
												<p>Patch Notes Version: 1.0.0 released June 1st, 2020
												</p>
											</header>

											<h3>New Features</h3>
												<ul>
													<li><strong>- LAN Multiplayer has been added</strong> as a means to play with friends over a local access network. This option is available at the main menu.</li>
													<li><strong>- Four new arenas have been added</strong> to the game: Ocean, Jungle, Volcano (Core), and Sky. These arenas are available for both gamemodes and multiplayer options.</li>
													<li><strong>- Three new characters have been added</strong> to the game: Garnoc, Moltra, and Aigua. All characters are available for all arenas, gamemodes, and multiplayer options. Players can select a character to play as in the character-select menu before a match.
													</li>
													<li><strong>- Ledge Recovery has been added:</strong> players can now perform automatically-angled dashes when off the arena to increase their odds of saving themselves. Ledge Recovery dashes are simply angled dashes, to which the player’s dash charge will be consumed when performing a Ledge Recovery dash.
													</li>
													<li><strong>- Pausing during matches has been added to Couch Multiplayer</strong> (press the Select button). A menu also becomes available during the pause for players to either continue the match or terminate the match early. (Note: pressing the “pause” button in LAN will not pause the game, however, the same aforementioned menu will still be available, allowing players to leave matches early.)
													</li>
												</ul>
											<h3>Changes</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>- The initial standalone arena, Volcano (Peak), has been removed.
													</li>
													<li>- The initial standalone character has been named Zephyr.
													</li>
													<li>- Menus now have an arena backdrop as well as smoother graphical transitions between menus.
													</li>
													<li>- Player heads-up displays (HUDs) have been polished for easier readability.
													</li>

												</ul>											
											<h3>Technical Changes</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>- For a given running instance of the application, the last-played gamemode settings and player settings are now saved to reduce repetitive inputs in between matches (Note: this data is cleared upon closing the application).
													</li>
													<li>- Many subsystems have been added to modularize functionality for easier maintenance and modification.
													</li>
													<li>- To mitigate performance issues for LAN Multiplayer, the UI-overlay system for characters has been refactored to consume less processing time.
													</li>
													<li>- The player-animation system has received more logic to handle more fluid animations.
													</li>
												</ul>												
											<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>- For Deathmatch, for all arenas, players would have a maximum of three lives before being permanently removed from the match.
													</li>
													<li>- Radial Earth would occasionally not raise destroyed tiles.
													</li>
													<li>- When attempting to start a Deathmatch game, once players had reached the character-selection screen, all controller input would stop being read, forcing players to force-quit the game to continue.
													</li>
													<li>- Players would have a limited amount of lives when playing Deathmatch, prematurely removing them from the match.
													</li>
													<li>- When getting knocked off the arena into decorative elements of the map, players could get caught on said decorative elements, preventing themselves from dying.
													</li>
													<li>- When playing a Deathmatch game, players would fall indefinitely and never respawn. This issue would then indefinitely increment the attacker’s total points, yielding previously incredibly large scores.
													</li>
													<li>- When attempting to select a character, Aigua was never available, even if a player started off as that character.
													</li>
													<li>- After a match completed, players’ names and colors were saved but not the character they played as.
													</li>
